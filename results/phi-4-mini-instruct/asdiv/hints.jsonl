Everyone else scored eight points each.\n\nReasoning: To find the number of players on Faye's team, we first need to determine how many points were scored by the other players. We do this by subtracting the points Faye scored from the total points: 68 - 28 = 40 points. Next, we divide the points scored by the other players by the number of points each of them scored:"}
